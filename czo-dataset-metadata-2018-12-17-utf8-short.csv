The overall goal of this thesis was to determine whether these two rock types impart distinct biogeochemical properties to soils and plants. The effects of rock type (lithology) on soil gas concentration, nutrient concentration and nutrient limitation were studied in the Ridge and Valley province of central Pennsylvania. To increase understanding of lithological controls on soil gases (Chapter 1), we monitored the depth distribution of soil CO2 and O2 concentrations in central Pennsylvania in two watersheds on different lithologies. We deployed gas monitoring instrumentation on two catena transects that included four topographical positions, one located on sandstone and the other on shale. As expected, with increasing soil depth O2 concentrations decreased while pCO2 increased. CO2 and O2 concentrations varied more with topographical position than with lithology, as the valley floor positions in both catenas had the highest pCO2 for a given depth.

Climate varied between elevations, with mean annual precipitation (MAP) from 292 to 800 mm, respectively, and mean annual temperature (MAT) from 9.4 to 5.6 °C. Vegetation was dominated by various sub-species of sagebrush at all sites. Lithology was derived from basalt and Rhyolitic welded tuff at all sites except Johnston Draw, which was derived from granitic parent material. Soils were collected from profiles by genetic horizons down to ~1 m or bedrock. Soil hydraulic properties were determined in the lab using a dew point potentiometer to determine the drier end of the soil water characteristic curves. Estimates of soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity near saturation were determined using a multistep-outflow and evaporation method. Soil bulk densities were also determined, and soil particle size distributions were previously determined (Patton et al. 2017). Using Marquardt-Levenberg type parameter optimization, soil hydraulic parameters for the standard van Genuchten-Mualem water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions were inversely fit. For several rocky subsoils where intact soil cores could not be collected, hydraulic parameters were estimated using a pedotransfer function (RosettaLite v1.1), bracketed using measurements from the nearest soil horizons. Results display subtle increases in soil water storage capacity (1.06%) and effective saturated hydraulic conductivity (~10%) moving from low to high elevations in the watershed. Both alpha (1.9%) and n (1.1%) parameters increased with increasing elevation and rainfall, typical of coarsening soils. In contrast, however, soil particle size distributions had more silt+clay fraction at the highest elevation site. Soil Bulk density was lowest at the high elevation site. Plant available water, determined from weighted average values of field saturated volumentric water content and the water content at the permanent wilting point displayed no trend with elevation or precipitation, suggesting potential tradeoffs in controls on ecohydrological processes with elevation. Not surprising, plant available water was highest in under-shrub soils vs. bare inter-plant patch spaces. In addition, the saturated water holding capacity was greater in surface soils at the low elevation site, with low precipitation, but greater in subsoil horizons at higher elevations with greater precipitation, presumably due to greater eluviation with greater precipitation totals.",Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed$Soil Hydraulic Parameter Estimates Along an Elevation Gradient in Dryland Soils$https://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/reynoldscreek/10/$1$n$https://doi.org/10.18122/reynoldscreek/10/boisestate$,Reynolds Creek|soil|hydraulic parameters,dew point|soil water|hydraulic conductivity|bulk density|soil characteristics,"Murdock, M.D., Huber, D.P., Seyfried, M.S., Patton, N.R., and K.A.

However, less is known about how Fe phase composition and crystal order relate to SOM composition and turnover, which could be linked to redox alteration of Fe phases. We tested the hypothesis that the composition and turnover of mineral-associated SOM co-varied with Fe phase crystallinity and abundance across a well-characterized catena in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico, using dense fractions from 30 A and B horizon soil samples. The d13C and d15N values of dense fractions were strongly and positively correlated (R2 = 0.75), indicating microbial transformation of plant residues with lower d13C and d15N values. However, comparisons of dense fraction isotope ratios with roots and particulate matter suggested a greater contribution of plant versus microbial biomass to dense fraction SOM in valleys than ridges. Similarly, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy indicated that SOM functional groups varied significantly along the catena. These trends in dense fraction SOM composition, as well as D14C values indicative of turnover rates, were significantly related to Fe phase crystallinity and abundance quantified with selective extractions. Mo¨ssbauer spectroscopy conducted on independent bulk soil samples indicated that nanoscale ordered Fe oxyhydroxide phases (nanogoethite, ferrihydrite, and/or very-SRO Fe with high substitutions) dominated (66–94%) total Fe at all positions and depths, with minor additional contributions from hematite, silicate and adsorbed FeII, and ilmenite. An additional phase that could represent organic-FeIII complexes or aluminosilicate-bearing FeIII was most abundant in valley soils (17–26% of total Fe). Overall, dense fraction samples with increasingly disordered Fe phases were significantly associated with increasingly plant-derived and fastercycling SOM, while samples with relatively morecrystalline Fe phases tended towards slower-cycling SOM with a greater microbial component. Our data suggest that counter to prevailing thought, increased SRO Fe phase abundance in dynamic redox environments could facilitate transient accumulation of litter derivatives while not necessarily promoting long-term C stabilization.",Northeastern Puerto Rico$soil organic matter; Iron phase crystallinity$https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/ffb66a2c60f34eeab2af7abd660bb81c/$0$n$$,Radiocarbon|FTIR|Mossbauer|Nitrogen isotope|Carbon isotope|Redox,Free light fraction percent N Free light fraction percent C Free light fraction C:N ratio Free light fraction C stable isotope composition|per mil relative to VPDB Free light fraction N stable isotope composition|per mil relative to N2 Occluded light fraction percent N Occluded light fraction percent C Occluded light fraction C:N ratio Occluded light fraction C stable isotope composition|per mil relative to VPDB Occluded light fraction N stable isotope composition|per mil relative to N2 Dense fraction percent N Dense fraction percent C Dense fraction C:N ratio Dense fraction C stable isotope composition|per mil relative to VPDB Dense fraction N stable isotope composition|per mil relative to N2 Dense fraction 14C composition|capital delta notation Dense fraction Fe measured in acid ammonium oxalate extraction|mg Fe per gram dry soil Dense fraction Fe measured in citrate-dithionite extraction|mg Fe per gram dry soil,"Steven, J.

A large proportion of P in these soils is bound to redox?sensitive iron (Fe) minerals; however, little is known about how Fe redox interactions affect soil P cycling. In an incubation experiment, we changed bulk soil redox regimes by varying headspace conditions (air vs. N2 gas), and examined the responses of soil P and Fe species to two fluctuating treatments (4? or 8?day oxic followed by 4?day anoxic) and two static redox treatments (oxic and anoxic). A static anoxic headspace increased NaOH?extractable inorganic P (NaOH?Pi) and ammonium oxalate?extractable total P (AO?Pt) by 10% and 38%, respectively, relative to a static oxic headspace. Persistent anoxia also increased NaHCO3?extractable total P (NaHCO3?Pt) towards the end of the experiment. Effects of redox fluctuation were more complex and dependent on temporal scales. Ammonium oxalate?extractable Fe and Pt concentrations responded to redox fluctuation early in the experiment, but not thereafter, suggesting a depletion of reductants over time. Immediately following a switch from an oxic to anoxic headspace, concentrations of AO?Pt, AO?Fe, and HCl?extractable Fe (II) increased (within 30 min), but fell back to initial levels by 180 min. Surprisingly, the labile P pool (NaHCO3?Pt) decreased immediately after reduction events, potentially due to resorption and microbial uptake. Overall, our data demonstrate that P fractions can respond rapidly to changes in soil redox conditions, and in environments where redox oscillation is common, roots and microbes may benefit from these rapid P dynamics.",El Verde Field Station$Phosphorus fractionation response to dynamic redox$https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/17d08a700064431180c55fc342bec839/$2$n$$,Luquillo CZO and LTER|Puerto Rico|Ultisols|plant available phosphorous|Hedley fractionation|Olsen P|redox oscillation|iron reduction,redox treatments| labelled vs unlabelled ryegrass| anoxic vs oxic headspace| day of experiment| mintues after swtiching headspace| NaHCO3 extractable total Phosphorus| NaOH extractable inorganic Phosphorus| NaOH extractable organic Phosphorus| HCl extractable Iron (II)| Iron in ammonium oxalate extract| Phosphorus in ammonium oxalate extract,"Yan Lin, Amrita Bhattacharyya, Ashley N.
